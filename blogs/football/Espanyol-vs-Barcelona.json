  "content": "FC Barcelona claimed a crucial 2–0 victory over city rivals Espanyol in a fiercely contested LaLiga encounter, extending their lead at the top of the table. While the scoreline suggests comfort, the reality was far more intense, as the match remained deadlocked for 86 minutes before Barcelona’s quality off the bench finally made the difference.\n\nBoth teams entered the derby in excellent form, each riding a five-game winning streak. Espanyol defended compactly, pressed intelligently, and created several on-target chances that tested Barcelona throughout the match.\n\nThe turning point came through the brilliance of Barcelona’s substitutions. Fermín López, introduced at halftime, delivered a decisive assist for Dani Olmo in the 86th minute. Deep into stoppage time, López struck again, setting up Robert Lewandowski to seal the win.\n\nAll three players involved in the goals came off the bench, highlighting Barcelona’s extraordinary squad depth and decisive game management."
